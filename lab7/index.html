      <h2>Biography </h2>
      <p>Hi everyone, my name is Jiayin Huang, I was born in a mysterious and beautiful night, so I naturally like to explore. The field I studied in my undergraduate study was not very related to computer science, but in recent years I have smelled that the field of computer and artificial intelligence will change people's way of life and even change the future of mankind. 
        So I decided to learn CS and become a great software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>I'm currently learning Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Web Programming, Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Software Requirements Analysis and Engineering. I believe that through my persistent study and hard work, I can definitely become an engineer, participate in the future construction, and realize my dream.</p>
