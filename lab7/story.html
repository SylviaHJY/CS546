  <h1>A wonderful road-trip</h1>
  <main>
    <p>I am a road-trip lover and camping lover. I will usually take at least one time road-trip to wherever and I will go camping during my road-trip.
      My favorite season is Fall, so most of the time I will choose to set off in autumn, the colorful autumn always excites me. 
      I absolutely love red maple leaves.
    </p>
    <p>One of my most impressive road-trip was in 2019, when I drove from Seattle with two of my best friends and passed through five different states: Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona. State. 
      We were on the road for 11 days and drove about 5600 miles. It was late autumn, the weather had begun to turn cold, and we encountered all kinds of different weather. 
      The sunshine in California put us in a good mood, but the snow in Nevada got our car stuck in the snow, and luckily we had kind people to help us, so we were able to continue our journey.
    </p>
    <p>Along the way we visited many famous attractions and visited several US national parks. We drove along California Route 1 all the way to Los Angeles, and to be honest, California Route 1 really didn't get tired of going 50 times. 
      We went to Santa Barbara and Santa Monica beaches and the beaches are always mesmerizing. Then we went to Las Vegas, the city that never sleeps. I don't know if you've heard the saying, "What happens in Las Vegas, stay in Las Vegas." 
      Of course, we didn't have crazy stories that happened in Las Vegas back then, haha.
    </p>
    <p>I strongly recommend that if you have the opportunity to go for a trip, you should go to Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon, they are simply the miracles of nature. Horseshoe Bay is very mysterious, it is a lake with a horseshoe-like island in the center, surrounded by cliffs, full of danger but beautiful. 
      Antelope Canyon is a canyon eroded by flood impact and rain infiltration, and its color changes with the sun. The most famous of these is the beam of light created when the sun is directly above the canyon gap.

    <p>So that's one of stories about me. Tell me if you like it.</p>
