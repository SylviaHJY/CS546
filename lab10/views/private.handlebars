If the user is logged in, and 'GET /protected' endpoint is called, you will render this view that displays:
-Username (which you stored in the session when they logged in) for the currently logged in user
-The current date/time

Also, you will need to have a hyperlink at the bottom of the page to /logout.
Define a button to logout!! <input type="button" value="Logout" onclick="location.href='/logout'">

<p>username: {{username}}</p>
<p>Current date/time: {{currentTime}}</p>
<footer>
